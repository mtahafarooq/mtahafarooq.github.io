Hi there! This is my first ever blog post and I am so excited to be writing this. I’ve been reading blogs like Dev and Medium for quite some time, and now its time to start writing my own blogs. One of the primary reasons to be doing this is to document what I learn.
We, humans, tend to forget a lot. Hence, documenting the problems I solve and what I learn will act as a safe for all my work. This will benefit other people who will get to learn something new and myself as well. Also, it feels great to give something back to the community.
Currently, I work as a web developer, I develop Single Page Applications (SPA’s) using Angular 7 and write backend code in Spring MVC. These are the major frameworks in my technology stack. As a hobby, I’m interested in learning advance java and javascript concepts. I’ve been a lot busy with my college and now my college comes to an end, I’ve decided to start exploring these fields once again while working as a web developer. So, my blog posts will include introductory posts on Object Oriented Programming in Java, Javascript concepts, web development, and scale. Since these are the topics I will be going through first.
