Hi there! This is my first ever blog post and I am so excited to be writing this. I’ve been reading blogs like Dev and Medium for quite some time, and now its time to start writing my own blogs. One of the primary reasons to be doing this is to document what I learn.
We, humans, tend to forget a lot. Hence, documenting the problems I solve and what I learn will act as a safe for all my work. This will benefit other people who will get to learn something new and myself as well. Also, it feels great to give something back to the community.  
Currently, I work as a frontend developer, I develop cross platform mobile application using React Native & Redux. I’ve been a lot busy with my day to day tasks at office and didn't get time for sharing my thoughts. But now, I’ve decided to start sharing my experience of exploring different javascript technologies by working as a developer. So, my blog posts will mostly include my learning experience of different technologies, reviews about courses that I took, and scale. Since these are the topics I will be going through first.
