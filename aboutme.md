subtitle: Aspiring Computer Scientist
---

I am a final year computer science student at COMSATS Institue of Information Technology, Lahore. I am passionate about web development.I spend major part of my day,practically everday, experimenting with HTML, CSS , JavaScript; dabbling with Angular,Spring MVC and SQL Server; and inhaling a wide variety of useful information through different sites i-e [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), [Medium](https://medium.com) Iâ€™m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand. I've developed a great interest in this field and I want to become a serious practitioner of computer science.

In my free time, I love to brush up my problem solving skills and solve programming problem on [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com). I also love to go outside for running but if the weather allows me.
