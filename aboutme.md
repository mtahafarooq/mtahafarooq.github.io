title: About me 
---

A passionate front-end developer who loves to turn intuitive designs into robust functional interfaces. I enjoy technology, not a specific stack or language. I spend most of time dabbling with React, Typescript and other technologies; and sifting through a wide variety of useful information through different sites i.e. [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), [Medium](https://medium.com) etc. I’m curious, and I enjoy any task that challenges me to learn something new. I do my best to keep myself up to date with new advancements in my field so that I can meet challenges with tools & techniques well suited to the job at hand.
