title: About me 
---

A versatile frontend developer who loves to combine the art of design with the art of programming and having  willingness to learn and  master backend development. I enjoy technology, not a specific stack or language. I spend most of time dabbling with React, React Native, Redux and other technologies; and sifting through a wide variety of useful information through different sites i.e. [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), [Medium](https://medium.com) etc. I’m curious, and I enjoy any task that challenges me to learn something new. I do my best to keep myself up to date with new advancements in my field so that I can meet challenges with tools & techniques well suited to the job at hand. I've developed a great interest in this field and my objective is simply to be the best developer that I can be and to contribute to the technology industry all that I know and can do.

In my free time, I love to brush up my problem solving skills, by solving programming problems on [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com). I love to go out for a run but only if weather is in my favor.
