title: About me 
---

I am a Computer Science graduate from COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore Campus. I am passionate about anything related to web. I spend most of time dabbling with Angular, SpringMVC and other technologies; and sifting through a wide variety of useful information through different sites i.e. [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), [Medium](https://medium.com) etc. I’m curious, and I enjoy any task that challenges me to learn something new. I do my best to keep myself up to date with new advancements in my field so that I can meet challenges with tools & techniques well suited to the job at hand. I've developed a great interest in this field and I want to become an expert web developer in near future.

In my free time, I love to brush up my problem solving skills, by solving programming problems on [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com). I love to go out for a run but only if weather is in my favor.
