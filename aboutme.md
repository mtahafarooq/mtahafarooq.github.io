title: About me
subtitle: Aspiring Computer Scientist
---

I am a final year computer science student at COMSATS Institue of Information Technology, Lahore. I am passionate about web development.I spend major part of my day,practically everday, experimenting with HTML, CSS , JavaScript; dabbling with Java and SQL Server; and inhaling a wide variety of useful information through different sites i-e freeCodeCamp.com,Medium.com. Iâ€™m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
